### Hi there 👋

- Just as many of you, I also became a software developer by self-study. 📖
- I'm currently a maintainer of Odoo's Point of Sale module. 💻
- I'm currently learning dynamic programming and some rust-lang. ⌛
- I sometimes solve puzzles in [Project Euler]("https://projecteuler.net/about"). 🧩
